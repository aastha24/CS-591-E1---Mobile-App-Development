Traffic Light

An app that simulates a traffic light. It displays a label and button. The label represents the current color of a traffic light and can be red, green, or yellow. When the user clicks on the button, the label cycles to the next color and simulates running the traffic light. The change of a View is done programmically. The two components are centered vertically.
